# Shopping List
This is a basic website that I created in order to practice and refine by HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills. All the website does is allow the user to create a shopping list by entering items in a textbox. This project is used to demonstrate my skills and understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in a small project.
